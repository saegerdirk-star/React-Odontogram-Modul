# `root_frac` below is Dirk's own reading off the Odontographie plates

#
#   11  4.4 / 6.4 = 0.593    14  4.0 / 6.9 = 0.633    31  3.6 / 6.4 = 0.640
#   12  3.8 / 6.2 = 0.620    15  3.8 / 7.5 = 0.664    46  3.2 / 6.8 = 0.680
#   13  4.4 / 7.9 = 0.642    16  3.6 / 5.6 = 0.609
#                            17  3.6 / 5.4 = 0.600
#
# Rounded to two places, which is the precision the readings carry.
#
# They corrected TWO inversions this table had. The canine used to hold a LOWER
# root fraction than the central incisor (0.60 against 0.62) where the plates
# give 0.642 against 0.593; and the lower molar a lower one than the lower
# incisor (0.62 against 0.68) where the plates give 0.680 against 0.640.
#
# The same cell counts also CONFIRM `length_rel`: normalized to the canine they
# agree with the values below to within 0.02 on six of the nine templates. That
# agreement is what establishes the Linienraster as ONE shared scale across the
# archive - which no measurement of the photographs themselves could settle,
# since the pages are photographed at different distances. The one exception is
# tpl 15 at +0.104, the GRAFTED template, whose length may have been set to
# serve the graft rather than the plate; left alone here, noted in
# odontogram-3y9.
# `width_frac` is the tooth's MESIODISTAL CROWN WIDTH as a fraction of its own
# length, and the rendered width comes out as `width_frac * length_rel *
# size_scale * H_REF` - so the number below is an anatomical width-to-length
# ratio, not a display choice.
#
# Corrected on 2026-08-11 (odontogram-t4c). The previous values carried no
# source and were not consistent with each other: measured against the mean
# mesiodistal crown diameters, the canine and both premolars came out about a
# fifth too wide and the incisors about a seventh too narrow, which is why the
# lower front looked sparse and the premolars overbearing. Unlike `root_frac`
# and `length_rel`, these are NOT read off the Odontographie plates - measuring
# a width automatically off those pages was tried and produced a fragment for
# tpl 31 and a clipped specimen for tpl 46, the same failure mode that made the
# cervical line unreadable (odontogram-3y9). They are the standard mean
# mesiodistal crown diameters (Wheeler / Ash & Nelson), averaged over the
# positions each template actually serves:
#
#   11  8.5    12  6.5    13  7.25 (7.5 upper / 7.0 lower)   14  7.0
#   15  6.83 (6.5 upper / 7.0 lower)   16 10.0   17  8.75 (9.0 / 8.5 third)
#   31  5.25 (5.0 central / 5.5 lateral)         46 10.5 (11.0 / 10.5 / 10.0)
#   51  6.5    52  5.1    53  6.0    54  7.3    55  8.2
#   71  4.15   74  7.7    75  9.9
#
# Corrected AGAIN the same day, once the generator started measuring a crown
# width as the outline's full extent rather than as the tooth material a
# horizontal line passes through (`crown_width` vs `silhouette_width` in
# build.py). The old measure dropped the groove between the buccal cusps, so
# every posterior template read about a third narrower than it is and was then
# scaled up to match its target. The values here are unchanged in KIND - the
# same table, the same reasoning - only the scale they are fitted against is
# now the right one.
#
# The scale is 4.048 units per mm, chosen so the upper arch's columns still add
# up to the width the chart had. The correction redistributes width between
# tooth classes; it does not make the chart wider or narrower.
#
# `col_px` follows from the same numbers: each column is its tooth plus 6 px, so
# every contact is 10 px. That is also where the Class I canine relationship now
# comes from. Both arches use the same rule, the lower incisors are narrower
# teeth, and 43 therefore ends up in the embrasure between 12 and 13 without
# anything being arranged by hand - see the note on `col_px` in ToothSpec.

# ---- Display, not anatomy ----------------------------------------------
#
# The two constants below are the ONLY place where the drawing knowingly departs
# from what the plates say, and they exist for one reason: in the odontogram the
# tooth is an icon in a row of thirty-two, not a specimen.
#
# ROOT_DISPLAY_SCALE draws roots at a fraction of their measured length, because
# the apical third carries almost no information at chart size. It is 0.75 since
# 2026-08-11, raised from 0.60 at Dirk's request for less compression.
#
# ANY change here must be mirrored in `src/perioGraphic.ts`, whose
# `ROOT_RESTORE_SCALE` has to stay the RECIPROCAL of this value. There the tooth
# is not an icon but the scale a probing depth is read against, so the perio
# chart undoes this compression. Leave the two out of step and pockets are read
# against a scale their own artwork disagrees with.
ROOT_DISPLAY_SCALE = 0.75

# LENGTH_SPREAD compresses the length DIFFERENCES between tooth classes toward
# their mean; 1.0 leaves anatomy untouched, 0.0 would draw every tooth the same
# length. It exists because a row aligned on the occlusal plane leaves the
# apices ragged, and measurement showed that raggedness is not a defect to be
# corrected but the anatomy itself: with the plate-measured values above the
# apex spread is 30 px, and correcting the anatomy moved it by only 3 px. So an
# even apex line cannot be had honestly - it can only be CHOSEN, which is what
# this constant does, in the open rather than by quietly editing `length_rel`.
#
# At 0.45, with ROOT_DISPLAY_SCALE at 0.75, the spread halves (33 px -> 15 px)
# while the tallest tooth stays where it is (117.7 px -> 116.9 px) and the
# canine stays visibly the longest. The mean is taken PER DENTITION, so the
# primary set keeps its own scale instead of being pulled toward the permanent
# one.
