// Bead odontogram-dma: what holds a removable denture to a natural tooth.
//
// A removable denture could be charted, but nothing that HOLDS it: a natural
// abutment tooth was offered an empty prosthesis list, and clasp, attachment
// and bar appeared nowhere in the repository. So a combined fixed-removable
// case was half-chartable — the telescopic crown on the abutment yes, the
// partial denture at the gap yes, but not that the two belong together.
//
// Dirk's structure (2026-08-11), which is three anchorings rather than one
// axis, and its correction the same day:
//
//   Klammer    any present tooth — crowned or not; a crown is neither
//              required nor a bar to it
//   Geschiebe  requires a crown, because it is built into one
//   Steg       between crowned teeth
//
// Only the attachment and the bar are gated on a restoration; the clasp is
// gated on the tooth being there.
//
// This module is DOM-free on purpose, like `bridgeOverlay.ts` — it is the
// derivation, and the renderer and the tests both call it.

 *
 * Documented limitation, the same one `detectBridgeSpans` carries and for the

 * state carries no per-bar grouping id. A bar per arch is the norm; a second
