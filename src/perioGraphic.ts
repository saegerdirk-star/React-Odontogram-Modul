//
// Periodontal-arc "Dental Chart" graphical redesign, Task 2: the tooth-row
// graphic — draws the perio arch by REUSING the existing `tooth-base`
// artwork (the same 4 templates the odontogram grid already loads), instead
// of drawing new art. Read-only: this module only ever fetches template SVG
// TEXT and parses it into its OWN, brand-new DOM (via `DOMParser`, same
// technique `odontogram.ts`'s `loadSvg`/`__renderActiveLayers` already use)
// — it never touches the live odontogram's `toothSvgRoot` tiles, so the
// existing SVG-fingerprint/FHIR/round-trip goldens are unaffected by this
// module's existence (parity-safe by construction).
//
// Two layers, deliberately split for testability (mirrors this repo's
// existing `__renderActiveLayers`-style pattern of a pure/sync core plus a
// thin async loader):
//   - `loadTemplateCache()` — the REAL app's async entry point: fetches +
//     parses each of the 4 templates ONCE (never re-fetched per tooth) and
//     memoizes the resulting `Document`s.
//   - `getToothBaseGroupFromCache()` / `buildBuccalArchSvg()` / `buildPalatalArchSvg()` — pure, sync,
//     operate on an already-built `TemplateDocCache`. Tests build their own
//     cache directly from the SVG asset text (`readFileSync` + `DOMParser`,
//     exactly like `parity.test.ts`'s `svgText()` helper) — no `fetch()`
//     needed, so these are fast and deterministic in vitest/jsdom.
//
// NO per-tooth pointer handlers here — this is read-only chart artwork (the
// interactive odontogram tiles remain the only clickable tooth surfaces).

 * measurement is still going. Molar roots came out at 8.4 mm, which puts every
 * pocket past ~8 mm — the ones that matter — above the drawn apex, in blank
 * space.
 *
 * This factor undoes the shortening here and must stay the RECIPROCAL of the
 * generator's `ROOT_DISPLAY_SCALE`. It is applied to the root ONLY (see
 * `getToothBaseGroupFromCache`): scaling the whole tooth about the CEJ would
 * drag the crown along and blow the central index band open, and the crown is

 * keeping 1.3 on top of `ROOT_RESTORE_SCALE` would count that length twice and

 * At a flat restore the canine reads 19.2 mm, which is more than the chart
