// Bead odontogram-6fi: turning the charted document into an ordered list of
// single-resource writes.
//
// PURE — no transport, no clock, no randomness. The executor in `./save.ts`
// runs what this returns; everything that decides WHAT is written and under
// WHICH id is decided here, so a re-save can be proved idempotent by a test
// instead of by watching a server.
//
// THE IDS ARE DERIVED, NEVER MINTED. `buildDentalCoreBundle` already owns a
// resource-identity mechanism: `payload.fhirIdentity.resources[key]` keyed by a
// stable key such as `Observation/tooth-state/16`, and `parseDentalCoreBundle`
// captures exactly those keys back off a bundle. So the plan builds the bundle
// once to LEARN its keys through the codec's own parser, derives one
// deterministic id per key, and builds again with those ids in place. No second
// copy of the codec's key scheme lives here — the codec tells us its keys.
//
// The transport SPI carries no transaction bundle and no PATCH, which is why
// this is a list of single-resource PUTs rather than one bundle POST. The
// consequence is honest and documented in docs/aidbox-live-mode.md: a failure
// halfway through leaves the earlier resources written.

 * charset excludes it — while a hashed token always does, so the two forms are
 * disjoint by construction rather than by luck. A dot is legal in a FHIR id
 * (`[A-Za-z0-9-.]{1,64}`), so the result is still a legal id.
