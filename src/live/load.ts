// Bead odontogram-6fi: turning what a server holds for one patient into a
// charted document, plus an honest account of what could not be charted.
//
// `assembleLoadResult` is PURE — it takes resources that have already been
// fetched. `loadPatientChart` is the thin I/O shell around it.
//
// THE PARTITION IS THE POINT. `parseDentalCoreBundle` is all-or-nothing: it
// returns `undefined` for a bundle carrying one resource it does not recognise.
// A practice server carries dental resources in other dialects — the charly
// adapter's `ze-befund` Observations under the full dental IG are this bead's
// named case — so those are separated out BEFORE the codec sees them and are
// listed in the load report with their id and profile. Neither the codec nor
// this module learns to read them: the delta is documented in
// docs/aidbox-live-mode.md, and widening the codec is bead odontogram-wl8.
