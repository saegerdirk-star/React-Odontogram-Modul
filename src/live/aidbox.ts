// Bead odontogram-6fi: the ONLY module in this repository that talks to a
// server. It lives under `src/live`, which the library entry point cannot
// reach and the published artifact does not contain — the odontogram itself
// stays free of transport, exactly as bead odontogram-3l1 fixed it.
//
// WHICH FACTORY, AND WHY. `@polaris/sdk/fhir` re-exports a `createFhirClient`
// that performs an ADR-027 de-identification IG drift check at boot by reading
// `/ImplementationGuide`. The `odontogram-live` machine client is scoped by
// AccessPolicy to Patient/Observation/Condition/ServiceRequest/CarePlan and
// cannot read that endpoint, so that PolarIS facade cannot boot against it —
// and widening the client to admin scope is exactly what this mode forbids.
// `@cognovis/fhir-sdk/client` `createFhirClient` performs no boot call; the
// deprecated `createFhirDeClient` alias is the same factory. The transport
// SPI, `createFetchTransport` and `extractNextPageUrl` are used unchanged.
// `createAidboxFhirClient` is not used: it is a client-credentials factory and
// is not the HTTP Basic scoped browser client.

 * never comes at all. Measured against Aidbox on 2026-08-23: six consecutive

 * resources every time, of which 101, 100, 118, 116, 118 and 110 were DISTINCT
 * — 10 to 28 duplicates per read, and as many resources silently absent. With
 * `_sort=_id` the same six fetches returned 128 distinct resources every time.

 * Read EVERY page of a search. A loader that stops after the first page shows a

 * as a truncated one. The page budget guards against a server whose next link
 * points at itself.
 *
 * Hitting that budget is REPORTED, not swallowed: the caller carries
 * `truncated` into the load report, so a partial read is never displayed as a
 * whole chart. The same silence this function exists to prevent must not come
 * back in through its own guard.
 *
 * AND THE ASSEMBLY IS COUNTED. Following links is not proof of completeness: a
 * dropped connection, a lost page, a link the server stops offering all end the
 * loop quietly, and a short read of a Dental Core chart PARSES — it simply
 * comes back missing findings. Measured on the live fixture: the app's own
 * whole-mouth save is 128 Observations against a default page size of 100, and
 * `Observation/...tooth-state-16` was entry number 100 — the first entry of
 * page two. Losing that page produced a chart that loaded cleanly and showed
 * tooth 16 with no filling. So the count the server reports in `Bundle.total`
 * is checked against what actually arrived, and a short read is a FAILED read.
 *
 * A server that reports no `total` cannot be checked this way, and this does
 * not pretend otherwise: `expected` stays undefined and `incomplete` stays
 * false. A page that FAILS still throws, and must — the caller turns that into
 * a failed load rather than a partial chart.
