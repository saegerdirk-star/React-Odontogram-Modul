/**
 * Which implant is in the tooth — the product, kept apart from the finding.
 *
 * `toothSelection === "implant"` says an implant is there. It does not say
 * which one, and the two are different assertions (odontogram-im1). This module
 * carries the second: what was placed, and enough of its identity to answer the
 * question that makes recording it worth the effort — *which patients carry lot
 * X* — after a manufacturer withdraws one.
 *
 * Two halves, and they answer different questions:
 *
 *  - manufacturer / system / diameter / length are what the next dentist needs
 *    in order to order an abutment onto it, years later;
 *  - the UDI is what a recall needs. Implant packaging in the EU carries one by
 *    law (MDR), it is scannable, and it encodes lot and expiry, so scanning it
 *    fills two fields that nobody wants to type off a foil pouch.
 *
 * NOTHING here is looked up. A UDI's device identifier is a GTIN that names the
 * product globally, but resolving it to a manufacturer needs a registry, and
 * this library takes no dependency on external dental systems (see CLAUDE.md).
 * So the GTIN is stored as the key it is, and the human-readable half stays
 * typed.
